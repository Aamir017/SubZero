- **Service Identification**: Recognize the services associated with vulnerable subdomains (AWS S3, GitHub Pages, Heroku, etc.)
- **Detailed Reporting**: Get comprehensive reports with vulnerability status, CNAME records, and HTTP status codes
- **Remediation Guidance**: Receive specific remediation steps based on the identified service
- **History Tracking**: Access previous scan results for comparison and tracking
- **Export Functionality**: Export results in CSV format for further analysis
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface that works on desktop and mobile devices

## üîç Usage

- Enter the target domain (e.g., example.com) in the input field on the homepage
- Click "Scan Domain" to initiate the scanning process
- View the results, which include:
- Summary statistics (total subdomains, vulnerable, secure)
- Detailed table of all discovered subdomains
- Vulnerability status for each subdomain
- CNAME records and associated services
- HTTP status codes and error messages
- Use the search functionality to filter results
- Click on "Details" to view more information about a specific subdomain
- Export results as CSV or print them for documentation



## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation

The application provides specific remediation steps for vulnerable subdomains based on the identified service:

- AWS S3 : Instructions for creating and configuring S3 buckets
- GitHub Pages : Steps to set up GitHub Pages correctly
- Heroku : Guidance on creating and deploying Heroku applications
- Generic : General recommendations for securing DNS configurations
##  üîí Security Considerations

This tool is designed for legitimate security testing and assessment purposes. Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning domains that you do not own.
